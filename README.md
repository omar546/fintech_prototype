# Fintech Flutter App Prototype

## Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a mobile app prototype for a fintech company using Flutter. The app aims to deliver an intuitive and seamless user experience, with a focus on the following core functionalities:
- Home Page
- Wallet Page
- User Profile Page

## UI Design

The UI designs for the home page and wallet page were attached to the email. These designs should be followed closely during the implementation process. Additionally, I will create a new design for the user profile page, ensuring it aligns with the overall app theme.

## Tasks

- **Home Page:** Provides an overview of the user's financial status, recent transactions, and other relevant information.
- **Wallet Page:** Allows users to view and manage their accounts, track balances, and view transaction history.
- **User Profile Page:** Users can manage their personal information, update settings, and customize their profile.
